# Reading Over Your head

* __An essential Skill__: Many professionals do not fully understand a paper the first time read it. They read it over, and over, and over again. Focusing on different things each time.
* __Sometimes your reading is an exploration__. Do not worry if you do not understand the details. Get a feel for the territory. For example, when you are reading user manuals get and idea of the techniques being discussed. Plan on coming back later when you need the details.
* __Or__, when you are reading technical papers about the topic you are studying; Read the introduction, and the summary. Skim the middle. Get an idea about the parts and how they fit together. Again, plan on coming back later, if and when it is relevant.
