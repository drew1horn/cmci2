### Free Conference Call
* May be a better choice than Google Hangouts. Lets Experiment
* Start with voice conference 
  * Time      Satuday 1:30Pm 
  * Call      (641) 715-0634
  * Enter PIN 925311

Once we have a working voice call let's move on to get videoconferencing, screen sharing, etc. working

### Teamviewer
* I was considering moving conferencing to freeconferencecall.com
* But, Teamviewer's ability to hand of meeting leadership, and screen sharing is **really** big
* Download and install appropriate version from: https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/
* Try it out

Once we have Teamviewer working we will be able to share our screens an talk about what is happening.
This will make the next installations easier.
